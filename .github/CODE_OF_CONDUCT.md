# Code of Conduct


1. **Before asking a question, try to answer it for yourself.**  
   if its already answered or just a retarded question in general dont even bother asking cuz u aint getting a response unless its a legitimatly useful comment/question/suggestion.

2. **Don't be a fag.**  
   I dont care what u think stfu unless u find a legitimate flaw in the code or a suggestion.
